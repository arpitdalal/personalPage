          Hello,my name is Dhara Dalal. I have completed my Masteres in Computer
          Application from India. Also, I have studied Software testing from
          Fanshawe College, Canada. I have more than 2 years of experice in QA
          field. Currently looking for a carrer as a front-end developer which
          mataches my interests. In my last job, i used to ask developers during
          my professional development period, how they make a webpage,what type
          of technologies they are using and many more. I also do inspect
          element and see how element is designed.
