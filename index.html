        <p>
          Hello, my name is Dhara Dalal. I have completed my Masters degree in Computer Applications from India. Moreover, I have acquired a software testing degree from Fanshawe College, Canada. I have more than 2 years of experience as a Quality Analyst. I am currently looking for a carrier in web developer space which matches with my interests. In my previous role, I used to ask questions to developers about how they create web apps, what technologies they use and why in my professional development time. Furthermore, I use browser developer tools on big website like Netflix, Apple, etc to understand how their engineers achieve such functionalities.
